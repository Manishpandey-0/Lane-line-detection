**Introduction**

1\.Lane Detection is a project that focuses on developing a system for accurate detection

and visualization of lane lines on roads.

2\.The project utilizes computer vision techniques and image processing algorithms to

identify lane lines in real-time from input images or videos.

3\.The primary goal of this project is to improve road safety by providing a visual

representation of detected lane lines, enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate within

lanes and make informed decisions.

4\.This project has significant applications in the field of autonomous driving systems,

where precise lane tracking is essential for ensuring safe and efficient navigation,

contributing to the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology.
